# Test Application

## Ruuning the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes

I used localStorage to persist users and liked photos data because writing to a file was not possible.
